### ðŸš€ Greetings 

I'm [Lincoln Mullen](https://lincolnmullen.com). I am a historian of American religion and the nineteenth-century United States, often using computational methods for texts and maps. I am history faculty at George Mason University, and Director of Computational History at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](https://rrchnm.org/) ([@CHNM](https://github.com/chnm) on GitHub).

My work on GitHub mostly involves my research projects. These are usually data analytical projects, but I have also developed some software packages. To give you a quick tour of the highlights:

- [_America's Public Bible: A Commentary_](https://americaspublicbible.org) ([repo](https://github.com/lmullen/americas-public-bible)) is an application of machine-learning to find millions of biblical quotations in historical U.S. newspapers and understand the results.
- [_American Religious Ecologies_](https://religiousecologies.org) ([repo](https://github.com/chnm/relec-website)) digitizes, transcribes, maps, and visualizes historical datasets about American religion.
- _Legal Modernism_ ([repo](https://github.com/lmullen/legal-modernism)) analyzes nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Anglo-American treatises, caselaw, and other legal documents. Our [civil procedure codes repo](https://github.com/lmullen/civil-procedure-codes) contains code for an [earlier article](https://doi.org/10.1093/ahr/123.1.132).
- Computing Cultural Heritage in the Cloud ([repo](https://github.com/lmullen/cchc)) was an experiment to apply machine-learning models across the Library of Congress digital collections using their APIs.
- I maintain the following R packages: [tokenizers](https://github.com/ropensci/tokenizers), [textreuse](https://github.com/ropensci/textreuse), [USAboundaries](https://github.com/ropensci/tokenizers), [historydata](https://github.com/ropensci/historydata), [internetarchive](https://github.com/ropensci/internetarchive), [gender](https://github.com/ropensci/gender).
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/lmullen/dotfiles) and [CV](https://github.com/lmullen/CV) repos.
  
You can find me at various places around the internet:

- [My website](https://lincolnmullen.com) ([repo](https://github.com/lmullen/lincolnmullen.com)).
- [My Micro.blog](https://weblog.lincolnmullen.com/).
- [My newsletter](https://buttondown.email/lmullen) about American religious history, digital history, and the making thereof.
